\alias{add_br_parallel}
\title{Add HTML line breaks to text at regular intervals (parallel version)}
\usage{
add_br_parallel(text, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Character vector. The text string(s) to process.}

\item{n}{Integer. Insert a line break after every n words.}
}
\value{
Character vector of the same length as \code{text} with \code{<br>} tags inserted.
}
\description{
Parallelised version of \code{\link{add_br}} using the \code{furrr} package.
Useful for processing large vectors of text strings (e.g., thousands of hover
labels for large plotly visualisations).
}
\details{
\strong{Important:} You must set up a parallel backend with \code{future::plan()}
before calling this function. If no parallel backend is configured, it will
run sequentially.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set up parallel processing first (adjust workers to your CPU cores)
future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 4)

# Process large vector of plotly hover text
long_hover_text <- rep("Your very long hover text here with many words", 10000)
result <- add_br_parallel(long_hover_text, n = 5)

# Always reset to sequential processing when done
future::plan(future::sequential)
}
